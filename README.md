# SymbOffice
This add-on, the first we developed, is a VBA macro for Microsoft Office. Just
about any font contains a large percentage of the math symbols one could want.
Of course, those that do not already exist on a standard keyboard, such as π and
÷, can be prohibitively difficult to generate quickly. This macro needs to be
run only once in Word, and over 200 symbols will have their corresponding TeX
macro invocation added to the autocorrect table for the whole Office suite.
This will allow one to have \pi autocorrect to π, \div autocorrect to ÷, and so
on, in Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook. This greatly speeds up typing
processes for those who need to write these symbols on a regular basis in Office.
